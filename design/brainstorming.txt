Brainstorming:
Weather:
    If weather is sunny:
        For pet mood: randomly pick between happy, hungry, sick,
        wanting love, wanting a toy, wanting to play, etc

        Default for sunny should be happy and happy should happen more often the
        other possibilities for sunny weather, happy has more weight?

        If weather is sunny and pet is hungry, pet will be happy after being fed
        Likewise if pet wants love, it becomes happy after being pet
        Additionally if pet wants toy, it will be happy after receiving toy
        Finally if pet wants to play, it will be happy after being played with

        Show a sun in the top left corner and yellow background

    If weather is rainy:
        Pet is sad

        Pet cheers up after user plays with it

    If weather is stormy:
        Pet is anxious and scared

        Pet will only go back to default after user pets it and gives it a treat

    If weather is snowy:
        Pet wants to play and will become happy after being played with

Health Bar:
    Color-changing: green, orange, red
    Bars for hunger, happiness, etc.
    If user is away for 8+ hours, pet becomes depleted: pet needs to be fed and played with in order to return to full happiness and health
    If user is away for 24+ hours, pet becomes sick: pet needs to be fed, played with, pet, brushed, and given a toy in order to return to full happiness and health
    Happiness and health bars will slowly go down the longer the user is away or if user is idle (not petting, feeding, brushing, or customizing)
    Each play action has a different point system attached to it
        If the pet is hungry, feeding it will fill the hunger bar faster than giving the pet treats
        If the pet wants to play, playing fetch will fill the happiness bar faster than the toy time or pet functions
        The weights for the different play functions are as follows:
            Pet increases happiness by 5%
            Feed increases hunger by 5%
            Fetch increases happiness by 10%
            Treat increases hunger by 1%
            Toy time increases happiness by 5%
            Brush increases happiness by 1%
    The user will see the regression of their pets health if they sit idle on the web oage for too long
        The health status bar will get smaller
        Hunger and happiness percentages will decrease
